Playlist Rules:
1. No song longer than 7 min or shorter than 30 sec
2. No duplicate song
3. No age restricted videos
4. Video added must be the best version of that song
5. Based songs only

Notes:
Songs from topic channels will probably break so avoid adding them. Nintendo sucks and keeps taking down all their own songs so avoid nintendo music.
