You will need ffmpeg, ffplay, and ffprobe for yt-dlp to properly add metadata to downloaded videos.

Playlist Rules:
1. No song longer than 7 min or shorter than 30 sec
2. No duplicate song
3. No age restricted videos
4. No more than 5 covers or remixes of any song.
5. Based songs only

Notes:
Video added should be the best version of that song. Nintendo sucks and keeps taking down all their own songs so avoid nintendo music.
