You will need ffmpeg, ffplay, and ffprobe for yt-dlp to properly add metadata to downloaded videos. You also need mp3gain.

Windows Setup:
Install yt-dlp release of ffmpeg and copy ffmpeg.exe, ffplay.exe, and ffprobe.exe into "Offline-Playlist" folder. Download mp3gain.exe and copy into "Offline-Playlist" folder also.

Linux Setup:
Make sure to set up .venv before running. Install ffmpeg and mp3gain with a package manager.

`sudo apt install ffmpeg mp3gain -y`

Playlist Rules:
1. No song longer than 7 min or shorter than 30 sec
2. No duplicate song
3. No age restricted videos
4. Based songs only

Notes:
Video added should be the best version of that song. Nintendo sucks and keeps taking down all their own songs so avoid nintendo music.
